HARBOUR STORE MANAGEMENT

The following transportation system is considered. There are stores in the harbour. 
Products from the stores are ordered and delivered to your warehouse and then loaded to arrived 
ships. Products are delivered every day except Sundays. 

It is necessary to organise the loading, ordering and storing process (during some time) so that total expenditure is minimal.

There are several business parameters:
1. Number of days under control
2. Moments of two ships arrival
3. Date of Sundays
4. Required total ships load
5. Minimal and maximal daily ships load
6. Penalty for load less than minimal amount (penalty for unload)
7. Penalty for daily order greater than was fixed
8. Initial product mass in the store
9. Storing cost

You have to find optimal solution (under different conditions) at least three times.
